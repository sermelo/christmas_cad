# Photo Frame 1
Released version

Future improvments:
* The ribbon is placed perpendicular to what it should, so the frame would turn to the side while hanging in the tree.
* Allow a pretty knot in the ribbon
* Make external decoration custonizable, so different shapes can be added after printed

# Photo frame 2

A version with more balance between the angles, however it is not as pretty as the version 1. So it needs a lot more work around the main design.
